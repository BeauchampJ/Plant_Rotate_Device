# Plant_Rotate_Device
## Description:
For MECH 307, we were tasked with creating some device that meets a certain list of requirements. We decided that the best project for our group would be to build a device that rotates a plant based on daylight cycles. We picked this idea because plants are something our entire group cares about. Ultimately, the project was a success and we were aple to complete it within the desired timeframe. Below are pictures of the device and a video of our project can be found at the following link:
