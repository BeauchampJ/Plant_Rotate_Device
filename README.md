# Plant_Rotate_Device
## Description:
For MECH 307, we were tasked with creating some device that meets a certain list of requirements. We decided that the best project for our group would be to build a device that rotates a plant based on daylight cycles. We picked this idea because plants are something our entire group cares about. 

## Package Contents:
- Arduino_Code: Code used to power our arduino
- Journal: Documentation of our project

## Note:
This is still a work in progress project. The final due date is 5/9/23
